# NaiNaiLong 🦖 
A peer-to-peer tutoring platform that connects students and tutors with flexible lessons, gamification, and an accessible web experience.  

## 📌 About the Project  
Students often struggle to find affordable and flexible tutoring. Traditional tutoring is expensive, rigid in scheduling, and limited to personal networks. Meanwhile, many talented peers have knowledge to share but lack opportunities.  

**NaiNaiLong** bridges this gap by providing a platform where:  
- Students can book **live or pre-recorded lessons** at affordable rates.  
- Tutors can **upload resources, conduct lessons, and earn through gamification**.  
- A **coin system and streak rewards** make learning fun and engaging.  

## ✨ Features  
- 👩‍🏫 **Dual Roles** – Switch between tutor and student.  
- 📊 **Dashboard** – Track coins, streaks, and progress.  
- 🎥 **Lesson Options** – Upload pre-recorded or conduct live lessons.  
- 🪙 **Gamification** – Earn coins and rewards for learning/teaching.  
- 🌐 **Web-based** – Accessible from any device, deployed online.
